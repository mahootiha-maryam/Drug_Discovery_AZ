In this directory we are going through preparing dataset for training the contrastive model.

This file is dedicated to make a dataset for training the contrastive model. 
The features of molecules are extracted by the morgan fingerprints with 1024 size. The reaction rules are extracted based on one hot vector and as we had 56 valid reaction rules this feature vector size is 56.

This file is dedicated to make a dataset for training the contrastive model. 
The features of molecules are extracted by the morgan fingerprints with 1024 size. The reaction rules are extracted based on difference of fingerprints in reactions and the feature vector size 2048.
